Zero Two Darling weight design for Kalam Unikorn.
Files Included:
- f3d drafts for modifications and changes if desired
- STEP files ready to send to manufacturer

Notes (For Over-the-shoulder design):
- Engraving depth will be 0.3mm
- When working with manufacturer, make sure to ask 
for several pics of different materials and finishes.
- If going for a mirror finish on the weight, make sure 
to request PVD or Electroplating over a polished mirror
finish, as the polishing reveals marks/lines in the final
product.
- Ask for an extra set of screws as these are free and
may come in handy.

Please let me know if you have any questions.
It's been a pleasure doing business!
