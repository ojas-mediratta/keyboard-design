Zero Two Darling weight design for Kalam Unikorn.
Files Included:
- f3d drafts for modifications and changes if desired
- STEP files ready to send to manufacturer

Notes (For Over-the-shoulder design):
- Engraving depth will be 0.3mm
- When working with manufacturer, make sure to ask 
for several pics of different materials and finishes.
- If going for a mirror finish on the weight, make sure 
to request PVD or Electroplating over a polished mirror
finish, as the polishing reveals marks/lines in the final
product.
- Ask for an extra set of screws as these are free and
may come in handy.

Please let me know if you have any questions.
It's been a pleasure doing business!

*Make sure to use "BlankCaseDeepWeightRecess.step" if you choose the
two-piece weight design. This is so that the two piece weight has the 
same clearance under the board that would be there normally. It will still
work fine on the refular file, but the deeper weight recess is preferred.
