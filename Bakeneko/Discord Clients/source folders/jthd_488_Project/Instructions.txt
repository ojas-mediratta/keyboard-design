Original CNC O-Ring Mount Board Design.
Files Included:
- f3d drafts for modifications and changes if desired
- STEP files ready to send to manufacturer

Notes:
- Engraving depth will be 1 - 2 mm 
(Depending on the part of the engraving)
- When working with manufacturer, make sure to ask 
for several pics of different materials and finishes.
- If going for a mirror finish on the weight, make sure 
to request PVD or Electroplating over a polished mirror
finish, as the polishing can often reveal marks/lines in 
the final product.
- Ask for an extra set of screws as these are free and
may come in handy.
- Mention that tolerances should be 0.2mm for parts that fit together
(if asked).

Please let me know if you have any questions.
It's been a pleasure doing business!
