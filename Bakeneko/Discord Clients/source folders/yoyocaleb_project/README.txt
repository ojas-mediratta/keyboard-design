Original CNC O-Ring Mount Board Design.
Files Included:
- f3d drafts for modifications and changes if desired
- STEP files ready to send to manufacturer
- SVG (Vertex) image file of engraving design

Notes:
- Engraving depth will be 1 - 2 mm 
(Depending on the part of the engraving)

- If asked about engraving depth, specify a 1mm depth.

- Provide the svg file to the manufacturer and let them know
that this design will be engraved on the outside of the weight.step
file. (the side with the filleted edges.) Be sure to request that the
engraving design is scaled to fit the size of the weight.

- When working with manufacturer, make sure to ask 
for several pics of different materials and finishes.

- If going for a mirror finish on the weight, make sure 
to request PVD or Electroplating over a polished mirror
finish, as the polishing can often reveal marks/lines in 
the final product.
** Edit: This note only applies to Gaojie MFG. Other manufacturers
can produce a perfectly good mirror polished finish.

- Ask for an extra set of screws as these are free and
may come in handy.

- Mention that tolerances should be 0.1mm for parts that fit together
(if asked).

Please let me know if you have any questions.
It's been a pleasure doing business!
